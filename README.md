# Running Multiple Python Scripts in Google Colab

This guide explains how to run multiple `.py` files stored on Google Drive in Google Colab.

## Steps to Follow

### 1. Open Google Colab

Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and create a new notebook.

### 2. Mount Google Drive

To access your files stored on Google Drive, you need to mount your Google Drive to the Colab environment.

```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')

!python {your_file_name}.py
```
